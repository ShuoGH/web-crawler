## Web Crawler
This repo records some basic web crawlers demo when I was learning the technique

File Catalog: 
- mzitu_crawler.py 
    - It's the **crawler** used to scrape the images from mzitu.com
    - There are some bugs existing in this demo. As you scrape the images, it will reach the max retrival and throw the error. I haven't found a better way to solve this problem.
